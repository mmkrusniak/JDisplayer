# JDisplayer
A standalone object bench.

### What it does
JDisplayer is a Java program for object visualization and testing. Essentially, it allows you to instantiate arbitrary objects, call their methods, read their fields, and use them for other objects. It's intended for use as a testing tool, and it's particularly good for complex objects.

### Idea credit
There's an IDE called [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/) that has this feature, and it's amazing for learning object-oriented programming. On the other hand, BlueJ is intended to be lightweight and doesn't have some of the functionality of fully-fledged IDEs. I thought it would be convenient to turn BlueJ's object bench into a standalone program useful for unit testing.

### bluugh why is it so ugly
Sorry about that. I don't have much fron-tend experience, and I was at the time (probably still am) too proud to use any tool outside of Java Swing. I focused more on GUI in some of my later projects, and I find I tend to get bogged down in it. Finished and ugly is better than not finished at all!
It's still a useful tool, and if I have the time someday, I'll renovate it.


Enjoy!
